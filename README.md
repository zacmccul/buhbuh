We're building a static site page using tanstack, vite, and the latest technologies.

It's going to be cute and is a site dedicated to a partner. It's going to be github pages that has a custom domain in front of it. 

We are going to have sections on it for various kinds of static hosted files in various categories.

Categories will be:
* Poems
* Music
* Art
* Pictures
* Writing

Key features include:
* Security: Despite it being static files, we do want to prevent easy access to the site from bots and random users. As such all content should be locked behind a password input that is challenging to reverse engineer.
* Run everything from a static site deployed to GitHub pages with a CloudFlare domain.
* React v19

Technology Stack:
* Tanstack
* vite
* GitHub Sites
* vitest
* Shadcn
* Tailwind CSS
