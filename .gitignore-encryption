# Encryption and .gitignore configuration

## This file should be appended to your .gitignore
## It ensures that only encrypted (.enc) files are committed, not originals

public/poems/*
public/music/*
public/art/*
public/pictures/*
public/writing/*

# But allow .enc files (encrypted)
!public/poems/*.enc
!public/music/*.enc
!public/art/*.enc
!public/pictures/*.enc
!public/writing/*.enc

# Allow hidden files that might be in these directories
!public/poems/.gitkeep
!public/music/.gitkeep
!public/art/.gitkeep
!public/pictures/.gitkeep
!public/writing/.gitkeep

# Never commit unencrypted environment files
